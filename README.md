# pblibsim

Update 1/8/2016:
This repo is under construction. I'll be pushing some usable updates soon, but they may require some adaptation to your configutations. Working on a more generalized version for the near future. 
******
This is a draft version of pblibsim.

cleanfasta.py is the complete simulation done with respect to chromosome

nochr_sim.py is the core of the simulation done without respect to chromosome. 
nochrsimbootstrapped.py includes distribution building for simulation results.
